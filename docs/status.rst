The GA4GH server is currently under active development, and several
features are not yet fully functional.  These mostly involve the
reads API. Some missing features are:

- Unmapped reads. We do not support searching for unmapped reads.

- Searching over multiple ReadGroups.

For more detail on individual development issues, please see the project's
`issue page <https://github.com/ga4gh/server/issues>`_.
