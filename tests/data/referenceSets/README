This is rag-tag bunch of references generated to match the 
test read data. The FASTAs were created by hand, and then
compressed and indexed using (eg.)

bgzip chr17.fa
samtools faidx chr17.fa.gz

For NCBI37:

Generated using 

python scripts/download_data.py --source=ebi --chromosomes=1,2,3 -V 5 -r0 --exclude-reference-min

the reference set data was then copied in here.
